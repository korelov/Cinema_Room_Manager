# About

Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.

# Learning outcomes

This project is a good opportunity to work with input and output in Java. You will deal with multi-dimensional arrays and functions as well as loops and conditional statements.
